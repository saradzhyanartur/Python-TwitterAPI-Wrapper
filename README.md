# TwitterCaller
Simple Python wrapper around a part of Twitter's API.
## Description
A foundation for a full Python Wrapper around Twitter's API. The TwitterClient class contains several basic methods for interacting with the API and can be easily extended to include further methods. The TwitterClient class currently only supports OAuth2 authentication and therefore is unable to interact with user specific endpoints. 
## Implementation
The wrapper was tested with
```
implementation = CPython
version_info = 3.7.6.final.0
```
The required dependancies are listed in the requirements.txt 
## Usage
Please refer to https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v3/ for detailed instructions. The ```demonstration.py``` file contains examples of usage.
